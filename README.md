The prokaryotic module of reactive species reactions (in the COBRA model format-SP_RSRM.mat) was constructed from the eukaryotic reactive species reactions based on the reactive species that are known to be present in Sporosarcina pasteurii. The details about the reactions and metabolites are given in SP2023RSRM.xls excel sheet.
